Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹,  
I've built this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). 
Feel free to grab a copy of the source code and build your own portfolio site.

The following softwares were used during development:
1. Ruby (3.1.0 or newer) - Previously was using 3.0.0
2. Gem (3.4.19 or newer)
3. GCC (9.4.0)
4. Make (4.2.1)
5. Jekyll (4.2.0)

Apart from above, I also used [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to manage ruby versions. Lastly, I built this site on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/).

Detailed installation guide to install the above requirements can be found on [Jekyll official site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).

### Running the site
After you've downloaded a copy of this site, you need to install Jekyll and it's dependencies:  
`bundle install`

Finally, if nothing breaks then you can run the site locally:  
`bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Note on Ruby Version
Recent Jekyll versions require Ruby 3.1.0 or newer. If you encounter dependency errors, please ensure you have the correct Ruby version installed. You can check your Ruby version with:
`ruby -v`

Happy Coding!
